            A doctorSpot is a streamlined and efficient healthcare solution designed to
            facilitate the scheduling and management of patient appointments with
            healthcare providers. This system typically encompasses an easy-to-use online
            platform or application that allows patients to book appointments at their
            convenience, view available time slots, and select their preferred healthcare
            professional. Simultaneously, healthcare providers can efficiently manage
            their schedules, access patient information, and receive notifications of
            upcoming appointments. This technology-driven system not only enhances patient
            access to healthcare services but also improves the overall operational
            efficiency of healthcare facilities, ensuring timely and organized patient care.
